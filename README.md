# BeagleCPP

******************************************************************************************************
I am slowly moving through the source to exchange out Mr. Gaona's hard work for the new specification.
******************************************************************************************************

This is a C++ library to control an am335x styled board from beagleboard.org.

`Originally, this source was written by Mr. Gaona...` I am currently changing it to suit changes in the fs.

I am Seth. I like this library and I wanted to see it updated for use w/ the current spec. from beagleboard.org. 

Please give some leeway on my building around the new specification for pinmuxing and allocating resources...

`Cross_Compiling` on the WSL2 instance and porting it to the BBB has never been more fun!

1. /Chapter01_GPIO/Listing_1.1/ is done for now for the am335x on the BBB.
2. /Chapter01_GPIO/Listing_1.2/ will done next...
3. Wait for the release.
