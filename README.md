# BeagleCPP

******************************************************************************************************
I am slowly moving through the source to exchange out Mr. Gaona's hard work for the new specification.

This is a C++ library to control an am335x styled board from beagleboard.org.

`Originally, this source was written by Mr. Gaona...` I am currently changing it to suit changes in the fs.

I am Seth. I like this library and I wanted to see it updated for use w/ the current spec. from beagleboard.org.
